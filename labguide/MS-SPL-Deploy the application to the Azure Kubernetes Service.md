## Exercise 03 : Deploy the application to the Azure Kubernetes Service
   
### Estimated Duration: 90 Minutes

## Overview

In this exercise, you will be deploying your containerized web application to AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) with the help of Key Vault secrets and ACR where you have stored your containerized web application images. Also, you will be exploring two ways to deploy the app to AKS. 

## Objectives

In this Exercise, you will be able to complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Tunnel into the Azure Kubernetes Service cluster
- Task 2: Set up Key Vault & Secrets
- Task 3: Deploy a namespace, service, and workload in the Azure Kubernetes Service using the Azure Portal
- Task 4: Deploy a service & workload using kubectl

## Task 1: Tunnel into the Azure Kubernetes Service clusterâ€¯ 

This task will gather the information you need about your Azure Kubernetes Service cluster to connect to the cluster and execute commands to connect to the Kubernetes management dashboard from the cloud shell.

> **Note:** The following tasks should be executed in the command prompt.

1. In the LabVM, search for **cmd (1)**, right click on the **Command Prompt (1)** then select **Run as administrator (3)**.

1. Log in to Azure with the below commands after updating the values in the command.

    ```bash
    az login -u <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject> -p <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>
    ```

     ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal for AKS showing adding a Namespace.](media/cn29.png "Add a Namespace")

     > **Note:** If you face any error while running the 'az' command, then run the below command to install the Azure CLI and close the command prompt. Re-perform step 2 in a new command prompt as Administrator.

    ```bash
    choco install azure-cli
    ```

1. Run the following command to set up the Kubernetes cluster connection using kubectl. 

   ```bash
   az aks get-credentials -a --name contoso-traders-aks<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="true"/> --resource-group ContosoTraders-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="true"/>
   ```

   ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal for AKS showing adding a Namespace.](media/cn30.png "Add a Namespace")

1. Run a quick kubectl command to generate a list of nodes to verify if the setup is correct.

   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

   ![In this screenshot of the console, kubectl get nodes has been typed and run at the command prompt, which produces a list of nodes.](media/cn31.png "kubectl get nodes")   

## Task 2: Set up MongoDB Secrets with AKS 

In this task, you will be creating a secret in the Kubernetes cluster to fetch the data from MongoDB.
     
1. Run the following command to create a secret using kubectl. 

    ```sh
    kubectl create secret generic mongodbconnection --from-literal=mongodbconnection=mongodbconnection --namespace=contoso-traders
    ```

    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal for AKS showing adding a Namespace.](media/cn39.png "Add a Namespace")

1. Navigate back to **ContosoTraders-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** resource group. Search for **contoso-traders-aks<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (1)** and select **contoso-traders-aks<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (2)** Kubernetes service. 

     ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal for AKS showing adding a Namespace.](media/cloudnative-v1-18.png "Add a Namespace")
    
1. Select **Configuration (1)** from the left side menu under **Kubernetes resources** and click on **Secrets (2)** section. Under secrets, you should be able to see the newly created `mongodbconnection` secret **(3)**.

## Task 3: Deploy a namespace, service, and workload in the Azure Kubernetes Service using the Azure Portal
   
In this task, you will deploy the API Carts application to the Azure Kubernetes Service cluster using the Azure Portal.
   
1. Select **Namespaces (1)** from the left side menu under **Kubernetes resources**. We have already defined a new Namespace for your API deployment. Going further, you will be using the **contoso-traders (2)** namespace only. 

    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal for AKS showing adding a Service.](media/cloudnative-v1-19.png "Add a Service")
    
3. Select the **Services and ingresses (1)** under **Kubernetes resources** from the left-hand menu. In the Services tab click on the drop-down arrow, adjacent to **+ Create (2)** and then select **+ Apply a YAML (3)**.
    
    ![This is a screenshot of the Azure Portal for AKS showing adding a Service.](media/cloudnative-v1-20.png "Add a Service")

1. In the **Apply with YAML** pane, paste the below YAML code, which creates a service in AKS **(1)** and click on **Apply (2)**. Make sure to replace the SUFFIX with the given DeploymentID **<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="true"/>** value in the YAML file.

    >**Info:** The below YAML script will create an AKS service inside the contoso-traders namespace that you have created in the previous steps. AKS Service is an abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service. 

    ```yaml
      #YAML Script
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Service
      metadata:
        name: contoso-traders-products
        namespace: contoso-traders
        annotations:
          # TODO: Replace 'SUFFIX' in the next line with whatever your ENVIRONMENT GitHub secret value is
          service.beta.kubernetes.io/azure-dns-label-name: contoso-traders-productsSUFFIX
      spec:
        type: LoadBalancer
        ports:
          - port: 80
        selector:
          app: contoso-traders-products
      ```

      ![Select workloads under Kubernetes resources.](media/cn43.png "Select workloads under Kubernetes resources") 

      >**Note:** While entering the YAML code, if you're prompted with suggestion **Draft with Copilot**, click the **Close** button to dismiss it.
      
      > ![](media/cloudnative-2.jpg)
       
1. Select **Workloads (1)** under the **Kubernetes resources** section in the left navigation. With **Deployments** selected by default, select **+ Create (2)** and then choose **Apply a YAML (3)**.

    ![Select workloads under Kubernetes resources.](media/cloudnative-v1-21.png "Select workloads under Kubernetes resources")

1. In the **Apply with YAML** pane, paste the below **YAML code (1)**, which creates a workload in AKS and click on **Apply (2)**. Make sure to replace the SUFFIX with the given DeploymentID **<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="true"/>** value in the YAML file to update the LOGINSERVER name of the ACR instance.

    >**Info:** The below YAML file will create deployment pods in the namespace contoso-traders. A Kubernetes Deployment tells Kubernetes how to create or modify instances of the pods that hold a containerized application. Deployments can help to efficiently scale the number of replica pods, enable the rollout of updated code in a controlled manner, or roll back to an earlier deployment version if necessary.

   ```YAML
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: contoso-traders-products
     namespace: contoso-traders
